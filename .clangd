CompileFlags:
  # Use the compile_commands.json generated by PlatformIO during build.
  # This gives clangd the exact include paths and defines the compiler uses,
  # eliminating false-positive "file not found" errors for Arduino/ESP32 headers.
  # Re-run a build (pio run) after adding a new environment to refresh this file.
